# Torch for R practice
Place to practice using the R machine learning framework Torch.

1. [Guess the correlation](https://github.com/iparakati/torch-for-R-practice/blob/main/guess-the-correlation-cpu.md)</br>
Adapted from https://torch.mlverse.org/start/guess_the_correlation/
  * [Alternate version](https://github.com/iparakati/torch-for-R-practice/blob/main/guess-the-correlation-cpu-no-enumerate.md) that doesn't use torch "enumerate" function. As of 2/22/2021, the torch "enumerate" function doesn't work with GPUs.


2. What if? Experiments and adaptations</br>
  * [What if â€¦ we wanted to train on GPU?](https://github.com/iparakati/torch-for-R-practice/blob/main/guess-the-correlation-gpu.md)</br>
